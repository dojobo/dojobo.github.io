    "text": "The European Southern Observatory builds, maintains, and operates ground-based telescopes. Their flagship facility since 1999 has been the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which hosts four “unit telescope” platforms, each able to mount up to four instruments.\nPeer-reviewed articles which utilize ESO telescope data are described by metadata curators (librarians) in telbib, the telescope bibliography. As Library Technology Specialist, I managed the automated identification and ingest of relevant articles into the database, and the metadata infrastructure for curators to annotate the articles. Our system also regularly collected a citation count for each paper, i.e., how many times that paper had been cited.1 Within the world of academic publications, citation count is often used as a measure of “impact” or influence in the research discourse.\nOnce curators had annotated article records with information about each article’s associated observations (“observing programmes”), ESO scientists began to ask interesting questions. One line of thought pursued by VLT Programme Scientist Dr. Bruno Leibundgut was: if we know what instruments are associated with an article, how many peer-reviewed articles has each instrument “generated” over time? And since we were actually interested in scientific impact, how many citations did those articles generate?\nMy roles in this project were\nThe findings were used by facility administrators to make decisions about upgrades. Findings included\nHere is the abstract for the paper which we published in The ESO Messenger:\nRead the full paper here: https://doi.org//10.18727/0722-6691/5032"
