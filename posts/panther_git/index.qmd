I teach Git and GitHub in two, 2-hour workshops. These are the slides. It's called Panther Git because the university mascot is the panther.

What's different about how I teach Git and GitHub? We learn the foundational concepts by exploring GitHub, before ever touching the command line tool. The sequence of introduced topics is very deliberate.
